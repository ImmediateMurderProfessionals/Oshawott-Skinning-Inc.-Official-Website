  <h2>Buy our stuff if you're from the People's Republic of China</h2>
<p>Lately, our admin team has noticed that the site where you can buy our products is blocked in the People's Republic of China due to being a Google Form. If you live in the PRC, have no fear! You can still buy our products by sending a DM to <a href=https://www.chess.com/member/bombcraft>our CEO on chess.com</a>. We may set up something more formal later.</p>
