  <h2>What is Oshawott Skinning Inc?</h2>

  <p>
  <blockquote>"Oshawott Skinning Inc. is a company, established 2022 and closely tied with H, that aims to be the very best, like no one ever was. We do many things, but we are mainly known for skinning oshawotts in a humane manner, as they die of natural causes before we can skin them. We are the leader of the attack on terrorist organization <a href="https://peta.org">PETA</a>, and we have many products coming soon, such as <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/869283151">plushies</a> of some of our admins."</blockquote>
