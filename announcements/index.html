    <h3>I will not be playing Splatoon 3 for a while</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted January 27, 2025 by BombCraft</p>

    <p>In late November 2024, I decided to take a hiatus from Splatoon 3 so I could play more Zelda TOTK. Now, I was planning to end this hiatus on March 1, 2025, but the other night I dropped my Nintendo Switch so now I cannot press down the right joystick, which is pretty important in Splatoon 3. I will not play Splatoon 3 until the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which I plan to get shortly after release.</p>
