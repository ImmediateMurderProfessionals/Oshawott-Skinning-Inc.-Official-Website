  <h2>Our banlist</h2>

  Anyone on this banlist is BANNED from working at Oshawott Skinning Inc, purchasing any products from us, and pretty much anything else related to this company. This banlist is, obviously, far from complete, like most things on this site, and will be updated as more people are banned from Oshawott Skinning Inc.
