  <p>Have you ever wondered what we skin Oshawotts for? Well, you're in luck. One of the things we use the skin for is clothing. Who knew Oshawott pelts could make such good high quality clothing?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, you cannot buy clothing yet since we have not finalized any designs, but stay tuned!</p>
