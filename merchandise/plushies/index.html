  <h2>Plushies</h2>

  <p>Starting Friday, February 2, 2024, at about 10:00 PM EST, we will start selling plushies of Blue and Corkie! (Before you ask, this isn't in HTS: The Website because I want all my merch to be on the same website).</p>
  <h3>How it all began</h3>
  <p>It all started in about April 2023, when I got an idea from my friend Steve4Space on Scratch (their username is GIitchInTheMatrix there) to turn Scratch users into marketable plushies. I decided to start with Blue and Corkie, as they are an inseparable pair. It reminds me of Moxxie and Millie Knolastname, but with much less sex because rather than husband and wife, they are brother and sister, and also Corkie is underage, being only 13 as of when I wrote this. I originally decided to plushify them on May 21, 2023, to celebrate my neighbor's ninth birthday, but eventually postponed it to May 27th as my Scratch account got temporarily banned from May 19-22. I would eventually post a video of me doing all that on June 25th, and it can be found <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/869283151>here</a>.</p>
  <h3>Production of the plushies</h3>
  <p>After a few months of mostly forgetting about the whole Become a Plushie! thing due to more important things like The Greatest Decade and the start of eighth grade, I got to the drawing board on October 21st to devise improvements to the plushies, with the goal being to start selling them by the end of March. On December 28, 2023, after two long months of late-night experimentation, I finally felt done with the plushie design, much to the pain of Blue and Corkie because I used them as test subjects for plushie-related experiments (side note: why did I get an erection while writing this). No more experiments will be conducted on Blue and Corkie, but I see them as works of art now. I might display them somewhere cool, seeing as I called my local plushie factory and they will start mass producing copies of the two very soon for me to sell, and usually, the first unit of a cool product is always the most valuable and awesome and whatever.</p>
  <h3>Other random shit</h3>
  I may edit this in the future.
