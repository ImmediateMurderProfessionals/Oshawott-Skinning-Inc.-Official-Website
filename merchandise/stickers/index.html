  <h2>Stickers</h2>

  <p>We do not sell stickers. If you bought stickers that have ANYTHING to do with me (BombCraft), you got scammed. If you spot someone selling stickers that have ANYTHING to do with me, kill the person and contact me about the illegal selling of unauthorized merch. Selling stickers related to me is punishable by death via I.M.P.</p>
