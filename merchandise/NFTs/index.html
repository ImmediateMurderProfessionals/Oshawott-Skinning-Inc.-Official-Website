  <h2>NFTs</h2>

  <p>We do not sell NFTs. If you bought NFTs that have ANYTHING to do with me (BombCraft), you got scammed. (Really, if you bought NFTs at all, you got scammed) If you spot someone selling NFTs that have ANYTHING to do with me, kill the person and contact me about the illegal selling of unauthorized merch. Selling NFTs related to me is punishable with death via I.M.P.
